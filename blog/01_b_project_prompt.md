## Assginment 1.2: project prompt

## Working Title: MagicPractice

## Description
- An app that helps musicians practice smarter by providing indexing, organization, and analysis of performance/lesson/practice sessions, together with knowldege of the score representation (image/symbloic).
- Target User Group: Adapt Musicians, Music Students, not Novice.
- Form factor: Ideally lives in a tablet that musicians can already use to read sheet musics from. Should on the outside just appear as a digital sheet music library app, but has all the MIR assitive tech built in. Due to technical restrictions though (don't want to touch iOS dev,) I'm gonna start with Web.
