# User path:

## I want users to record their practice/lesson/rehearsal sessions and I'll help them organize their stuff and help suggest how to start your practice sessions and what to practice

## Error:
- Procrastination
- Ineffective practice
- No logging on time or content practiced
- No opportunity for MIR or any digital tools

## Short Path:
- the user start to practice and need to *[barrier]* log the time and record the sound.
- The user opens the app the next time she wants to practice and see suggestions on what to practice.
- Every time the user opens the app, provide some basic informatics (like how long you practiced each day), and more advanced ones to come (like progress and mistake type etc.)

## Long Path (involving annotation):
- follow short path to collect material
- provide annotation interface for discovery, relistening and human analysis of recorded materials. *[Need to thing through]*
- The user will listen and annotate on some sort of visual representation of the music (Sheet music? Waveform? Spectralgram? Automated structural segmentation?)

## Want:
Cross sessional associations and maybe a database of practice session patterns.

## Notes during class:
- [physical signal to synth](sunhou.se)
- [8 button piano/ google](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/pianogenie)

- Excercise Apps
- Social Media

- What is it about a practice that's fulfilling (Talk to some people)
